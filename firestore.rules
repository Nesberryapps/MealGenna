/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for
 * personal data (profiles, meal plans) while providing public read access to
 * shared application data (recipes, ingredients). The security model is
 * designed for performance and simplicity by avoiding cross-document reads.
 *
 * Data Structure: User data is strictly segregated within a user-specific
 * data tree at /users/{userId}. This isolates private information. Global,
 * shared data like recipes and ingredients are stored in top-level collections
 * for easy, public querying.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only access documents within their own
 *   /users/{userId} path. They cannot read, write, or even see the existence
 *   of another user's data.
 * - No User Listing: The ability to list all users in the /users collection
 *   is disabled to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Data: The /recipes and /ingredients collections are globally
 *   readable by any client (authenticated or not) to power the application's
 *   core functionality. Writes to these collections are disabled for clients,
 *   assuming they are managed by a trusted backend or admin process.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Access to subcollections like
 *   /mealPlans is granted based on the {userId} in the path, a highly
 *   performant pattern that requires no extra document reads.
 * - Structural Segregation: Private meal plans are nested under the user who
 *   owns them, while public recipes are in a separate top-level collection.
 *   This is more secure and performant than mixing public and private data
 *   in a single collection.
